              Steven Barrios here! I love programming, writing, speaking, learning, traveling and food. I do spend most of my free 
              time with my dog or learning about new techologies. Aside from visiting cournties and experiencing new foods and cultures, 
              I enjoy nature and scenic views with a good cup of coffee. <hr />
